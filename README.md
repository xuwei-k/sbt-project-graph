`sbt-project-graph` is an [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) plugin to help visualise inter-project dependencies.

Inspired by [sbt-dependency-graph](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph).

## Setup

  [Global plugins]: http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/tutorial/Using-Plugins.html#Global+plugins

`sbt-project-graph` is an informational plugin and isn't ever a requirement of any build.

Therefore it is recommended to install it as a [global plugin][Global plugins] so that it's always available.

To do so, add it to `~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/plugins.sbt` or `~/.sbt/1.0/plugins/plugins.sbt` (or both; create the
files if necessary) as such:

    addSbtPlugin("com.dwijnand" % "sbt-project-graph" % "0.3.0")

As `sbt-project-graph` is an auto plugin that is all that is required.

## Tasks

  [DOT]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)

* `projectsGraphDot`: Creates `target/projects-graph.dot` with the project graph. See [DOT][].
* `projectsGraphSvg`: Creates `target/projects-graph.svg` with the project graph.
